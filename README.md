# Fetch Exercise

### Description:
This is a exercise made for [Fetch](https://fetch.com/) . The App is made using Koin for Dependency Injection, Jetpack Compose for UI/Navigation, Retrofit/Gson for requesting / parsing API data, and DataStore for Caching data. In this app, you are able to view the items from the API request in two different view types: List and Category view. This app includes mock functions like being able to add items to your cart and view the total mock price with a list of your cart's items. The app also contains Dark/Light mode features.
